Hi, Iâ€™m Anton! Iâ€™m an Unreal Engine UI Developer. Iâ€™d been messing around with UE for many years and 2 years ago, I decided to start doing it professionallyðŸ™ƒ

After having graduated from a Physics and Technology school with an IT major, I started working at DreamVR studio where Iâ€™m working to this day. Check out my projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio). 

In my free time, I develop my own independent games and plugins. Take a look [here](/projects).

## Silly little facts

- I like weird (just like myself) animals such as fish, isopods, snails, and frogs
- I have 2 awesome pet toads 
- my favourite food is shrimp
- I like the ocean and also I have thalassophobia (fear of deep water)

Welcome to my page. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve stumbled upon it and I hope it can be of some use or interest to you.
