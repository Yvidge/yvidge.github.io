Hi, I’m Anton! I’m an Unreal Engine UI Developer. I’d been messing around with UE for many years and 2 years ago, I decided to start doing it professionally 🙃

After having graduated from a Physics and Technology school with an IT major, I started working at DreamVR studio where I’m working to this day. Check out my projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio). 

In my free time, I develop my own independent games and plugins. Take a look [here](/projects).
