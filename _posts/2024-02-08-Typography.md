## Definition  
**Typography** is the visual component of the written word.

Purposes of typography:
- Utility: text should be legible, clear
- Emotional connection: create the right vibe of your product (imagine getting bills in Comic Sans)

Typography vs Lettering:
- Typography — working with pre-made letter system like typefaces and fonts to create layouts
- Lettering — crafting letterforms for a single use and purpose (also see Calligraphy)

## Short history

**Roman** inscriptional capitals — describe monuments and buildings  
**12th century:** Black letter — gothic style calligraphy script used by monks  
**15 - 16th centuries:** Roman typefaces became popular because blackletter was hard to read  
**18th century:** serif fonts  
**Industrial revolution:** start of design experiments. Magazines and promotion material. Slab serif.  
**Late 1920:** Futura (sans serif), Gill Sans  
**1950s, Switzerland:** Helvetica typeface quickly came in use in every form of printing.  
**Computer revolution:** many experiments with design.  

## Basic terms

**Typeface** — fonts with a common design, characters that share common features (Roboto)  
**Font** — particular set of properties of a typeface (Roboto light 48pt)  

**Cap height** — the height of the capital letters.  
**Baseline** — the invisible line upon which letters rest.  
**[X-height](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/x_height)** — the height of the lowercase letter, excluding descenders and ascenders.  
**Descenders** and **Ascenders** — downward / upward part of a letterform (often a vertical stroke) that extends above the x-height.  

**Serifs** — projections that finish off the main strokes of a letter. They can sometimes add legibility as they help the reader to follow the letter forms.  

> In UE:  
> Font family (font asset) — typeface  
> Typeface — font weight  

## Classification
### Serif
Serifs are small feet at the end of a stroke on the letter. Character used to be created by chiseling on stone. Serifs help the reader follow the letter forms.  
Books, magazines, newspapers.

- Humanist (1460s) — strong calligraphic influence, diagonal stress, lower strokes contrast. (Sorts Mill Goudy)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Sorts Mill Goudy', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Old style (15th - 18th Century) — serifs slightly rounded, slightly inclined. Characters have a diagonal stress. Low contrast between thick and thin strokes. (Goudy Bookletter)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Goudy Bookletter 1911', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Transitional (18th Century) — sharper serifs, vertical stress, higher strokes contrast. (Baskerville)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Modern / Didone (Late 18th Century) — flat and straight serifs, vertical stress, much higher strokes contrast. (Bodoni)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Bodoni Moda', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Slab Serif (Early 19th Century) — heavy and squared serifs, vertical stress, uniform stroke. (Graduate)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Graduate', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity </span>

These typefaces can be used as body copy as they are easy to read (except Slab serif)

### Sans Serif
Sans comes from the French, means without. So Sans Serif means **Without Serifs**
- Grotesque (1900's) — slight contrast between strokes, open aperture gap (a and e), double story on “g” (Bw Glenn Sans, Bricolage Grotesque)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Bricolage Grotesque'; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Neo Grotesque (later in the 1900s) — uniform stroke, close aperture gap, single story “g” (Helvetica, Physis, Work Sans)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Work Sans', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Humanist — calligraphic influence, Roman style proportions, slight strokes contrast, slight stress, wider aperture, double story “g” (Tahoma, Gill Sans Nova, Cabin)  
<span style ="font-family: Cabin, Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Geometric — little to no stroke contras, rectangular and circles, typically vertical stress (Futura, Geo)  
<span style ="font-family: Geo, Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>

Sans Serifs aim high legibility at long distance and in body copy.

### Script
These are based on the flow of cursive handwriting and not suitable for body copy. Can be used for display texts, headlines, titles or very short copy.
- Formal — elegant, inspired by 17th and 18th century handwriting. Each character includes an **endtail for fluidity**. Exaggerated flourishes (Bickham Script Pro 3, Petit Formal Script)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Petit Formal Script', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
- Casual — inspired by word brush strokes in the 20th century. More relaxed and friendly compared to formal scripts (Castinos, Damion)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Damion', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>

### Calligraphic
Imitates brush and nib strokes, staying contemporary (Bilow, Great Vibes)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Great Vibes', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>
### Handwriting
Informal (Summer, Kalam)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Kalam', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>

### Blackletter / Gothic
High contrast between strokes, specific appearance (UnifrakturCook)  
<span style ="font-family: 'UnifrakturCook', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>

### Display / Decorative
These fonts don't really fit into any of the previous categories. Not suitable for body copy, often experimental. Tattoo and graffiti can be included in this category (Monoton)  
<span style ="font-family: 'Monoton', Arial; font-size:2em">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity</span>

## Type Families

The idea behind type families is that characters within the family would share a common DNA with slight distinctions. Having such a wide range of typeface weights gives us the ability to create hierarchystaying minimalistic.

- Font Weight — from ulta light to extra black
- Style / Italic — true italic (more calligraphic) or oblique (less calligraphic, slight slant)
- Proportion — width of a character in relation to its height; from condensed to wide. Pretty rare.

## Legibility
A reader's abitity to recognize one character from the next.

Legibility is affected by:
- X-Height — height of the lowercase character in proportion to the capital's. The taller the X-Height, the more legible the typeface tends to be.
- Character Width — condensed or extended characters are harder to read.
- Weight — very light or heavy weight are extremely hard to read.
- Design Trades — should be more or less neutral, nothing too quirky
- Stroke Contrast — can reduce legibility. Heavy weights and small contrast results in extra hard to read text, especially in small point size.
- Serif — serifs are believed to enhance legibility.

Not all fonts designed to be legible. Consider:
- Content  
- Length  
- Audience  

## Readability
The arrangement of words in order to make written content flow in a clear, simple, and easy to read manner.
- Type Size — between 12 and 14 pixels for body copy
- Type Case — UPPERCASE is hard to read, use Sentence Case for body copy
- Line Space or Leading — rule of thumb is to have a letting value between 1.25 and 1.5 times greater than the font size
- Line Length or Column Width. Too narrow — too much eye jumps; too wide — hard to follow. Normal amount is 45 - 70 characters per line
- Kerning and Tracking
> Kerning — amount of space between specific pairs of characters (e.g. We)  
> Tracking — space between a group of letters in a block of text. <span style="letter-spacing:5px;"> Example.</span> Useful when working with all caps or heavier weight fonts.  
- Color and Contrast.


## Choosing fonts

Step Zero: Check brand guidelines if you have any.

Long Copy / Body Copy:
- Serif
<br> Personality: Traditional, formal, practical, serious. Legible.
- Sans Serif
<br> Personality: Clean, minimalistic, contemporary, sleek.
- Slab Serifs
<br> Personality: bold, quirky, sometimes modern.
<br> Use only for short body copy or display.

Display:
- Scrips, handwritten and calligraphic
<br> Personality: organic, warm and a personal touch.
<br> Can be anything from casual to formal.
<br> Use only for short display as they are illegible.
- Display (obviously)
<br> Actually, anything than not fit in categories above.

## Font combination
- Easy way: use a single font family. Use different weights, sizes, and colors to create hierarchy.
- Keep it minimal: combine only 2 to 3 different fonts.
- You may try combining display with serif or sans serif.
- Fit your fonts in a context of a project.
- Combine fonts from the same Designer.
