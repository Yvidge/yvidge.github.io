Turing machine 3D emulator written in C++ and UE4.


**Info:** Turing machine is an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip depending on current and defined states. Turing machine can implement any algorithm! [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#:~:text=A%20Turing%20machine%20is%20a,A%20physical%20Turing%20machine%20model.)

I made this project as one of my school assignments. I tried to make it look unique (i.e. 3D) and a bit retro.

This machine supports instant and step by step simulations, editing of tape and state tables, flexible import from spreadsheets. Also it builds action stack for better understanding of execution process.

## The experience I got:
- Working with procedural UMG widgets in 3D space
- Understanding of Turing Machines
