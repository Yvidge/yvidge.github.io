Small game demo I made to figure out more about **Gameplay Ability System**

<div class = "badge-box">
  {% include badge-button.html url = "https://github.com/Yvidge/GASProject" badge = "GitHub" %}
</div>

## The experience I got:
- Working with Gameplay Ability System
- Creating different types of abilities and effects including movement, projectiles, lasers, AOE, etc.
- Creating stylized Niagara VFX for abilities
- Connecting Behavior Trees with GAS
