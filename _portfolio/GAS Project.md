I tried to make the visual style as simple as possible and add accents with Niagara VFXs.

Features:
- Projectiles with ability to explode
- Lasers. Instant, continuous, charging
- Buffs/Debuffs
- AOE Abilities with area selection
- Movement abilities
- AI working with GAS via Behavior Trees

## The experience I got:
- Working with Gameplay Ability System
- Creating different types of abilities and effects including movement, projectiles, lasers, AOE, etc.
- Creating stylized Niagara VFX for abilities
- Connecting Behavior Trees with GAS
