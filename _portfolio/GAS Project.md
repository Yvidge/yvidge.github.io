Small game demo I made to figure out more about **Gameplay Ability System**

[Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Yvidge/GASProject) 

## The experience I got:
- Working with Gameplay Ability System
- Creating different types of abilities and effects including movement, projectiles, lasers, AOE, etc.
- Creating stylized Niagara VFX for abilities
- Connecting Behavior Trees with GAS
