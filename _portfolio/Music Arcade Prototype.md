Project that I made during my internship at DreamVR.

This is a simple game prototype using core mechanics from OSU.  I completed this project as a test assignment before being admitted to work on [Scratch&Beat](/portfolio/Scratch&Beat/), as these projects are conceptually similar. 

Also, this prototype was used as an example project for the company's QA test assignments.

## The experience I got:
- Finding balance between development speed and code quality
- Working according to the terms of reference
