Small horror game about going down the stairs.

I made this game as a funny remake / free interpretation of [SCP-087-b](https://www.scpcbgame.com/scp-087-b.html). The core part are similar, but Stairs has more content, different encounters and sanity system.

Also this is my first complete **game,** and not just demo or tool.

The game has fun feature with runtime texture loading - you can change walls and floors to anything you want

## The experience I got:
- Creating game as solo developer from idea to release
- Searching for free assets, creating content from limited resources
- Finding workarounds if the mechanics / content turns out to be too expensive to develop
