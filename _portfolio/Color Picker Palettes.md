Simple UE plugin that makes the work under the color guide easier.

I wrote this plugin because I was really annoyed with copy-pasting colors from Figma while working. The plugin extends the color picker, so you can easily access predefined colors straight from the editor.

Also, it was created with team work and source control in mind, so configs separated to have important data shared between all team members while staying highly configurable for everyone in regards to the features they want to use.
